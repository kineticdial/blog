## About this site

I described this site to a friend as a place I can write down "oh sh!t, well I
shouldn't ever do that again" moments for posterity. "Field notes from a
software engineer" is just a much nicer way of putting it.

For the curious, it is built with [NGINX][nginx] serving static HTML pages
generated by [Jekyll][jekyll], and it is optimized for Safari Reader mode. I
use [Bootstrap][bootstrap] for stylingâ€”hopefully you can't notice.

It goes without saying that the thoughts I express here are mine, and not
necessarily representative of the company I work for.

## About me

My life can be easily summarized in four bullets:

- I have an amazing partner and two cats.
- I'm a software engineer at [F5 Networks][f5] in Seattle.
- I play beer-league hockey in the [Greater Seattle Hockey League][gshl].
- I attend university part-time at [Arizona State University][asu].

Anything more than that is too personal for the internet. ðŸ™ƒ
