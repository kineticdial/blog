My life can be easily summarized in four bullets:

- I have an amazing partner and two cats.
- I'm a software engineer at [F5 Networks][f5] in Seattle.
- I play beer-league hockey in the [Greater Seattle Hockey League][gshl].
- I attend university part-time at [Arizona State University][asu].

Anything more than that is too personal for the internet. ðŸ™ƒ
